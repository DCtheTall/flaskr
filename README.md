# Flaskr
A simple blog application built using the tutorial in Flask's
[documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/).

This was just and educational exercise to learn Flask.
I posted the code to Github so that I can view it later
and so anyone interested can see a full example of the
app the tutorial teaches you how to build.
